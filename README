NAME

Test::Requires::Git - Check your test requirements against the available version of Git

SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Requires::Git;

    # needs some git that supports `git init $dir`
    test_requires_git version_ge => '1.6.5';

DESCRIPTION

Test::Requires::Git checks if the version of Git available for testing
meets the given requirements.

The "current git" is obtained by running "git --version" (so the first
"git" binary found in the "PATH" will be tested).

If the checks fail, then all tests will be skipped.
